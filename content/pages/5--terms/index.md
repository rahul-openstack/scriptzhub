### Biased

Views of different members of the community are just that, and only that individuals opinion. Writers views in their articles do not necessarily represent the view of the blog as a whole. Likewise comments do not represent Scriptzhub stance, merely that individuals.

At all times we try to ensure the blog remains as impartial as possible.

### Comments

All users have the right to comment anonymously. We will not publish your email address if you choose to use it. It is helpful if you use your name or a nickname or alias.

If you have a Gravatar it will appear alongside your comment, if you don’t you will be automatically assigned one. For more information see our article on Gravatar.

Comments must be written in good English.

All comments must add value to the blog, so they must either contribute useful information, answer someone’s question, continue a conversation, or be considered worthy for another reason.

Comments may be republished on the blog, elsewhere on the Internet or in other forms of publication. Comments and trackbacks that are not approved may still be used.



### Your Data

Sensitive data that you leave on the blog when you comment, subscribe etc. (such as your email address) will never be made public without your prior permission, and it will never be sold to third parties.



### Sponsored Content

Unfortunately, blogging is not always free. In order to create a good blog, you often have to purchase a domain name, rent hosting, buy plugins and themes etc. Scriptzhub is a community blog, however the editor team pick up these costs.

In order to help fund such costs, from time to time we may host sponsored content. This may be in the form of a competition, editorial, video or other means. Should you ever see content on the blog declaring it is sponsored, then it has been done so in order to contribute to maintenance costs.

Please be aware that the editor team will never publish content which they believe could harm the blog, would not be beneficial to users, is tasteless, or not relevant to the blog.



### External Content

Scriptzhub is not responsible or liable in any way for the content of external sites. We may choose to link to external sites, however we accept no liability for them. If writers recommend products or services (including software) then that is the recommendation of that individual writer alone, and not the editor team, or the community as a whole.
